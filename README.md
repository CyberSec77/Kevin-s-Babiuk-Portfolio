# Kevin-s-Babiuk-Portfolio
A small portfolio I will be using to show all the projects, I will be making over the years.
This project was created by Kevin Babiuk to show college that I have experience in coding.
You may use any of the code or try the JS typing effect that I made:)
You also might need Live Server to make the website work and change the json file depending on the port you use (It's what happened to me).
