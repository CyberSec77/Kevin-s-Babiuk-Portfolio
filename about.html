<div class="aboutMe">
<p>Hi, my name is Kevin, I'm a 18 year old highschool student who has a passion for learning code. Since I can remember, I've always been passionate about computers and I always loved to make
    something from sratch. At the age of 9, I made my first ever video game which was 3D horror game where you had to kill mutated monsters. As I got older, I decided to get into more advanced ways of learning code, so I decided 
to use Codecademy and freecodecamp to learn it which were the best tools I've ever used. As someone who had to self-teach himself to learn HTML, CSS, Python, Java and Javascript, I had to really 
read a lot of different types of code, from different people and also make my own code so I may have a project I'm proud of. I hope that when I send the link to the college of my choice for the computer science program, I 
hope they see my hard work and passion, and why they should choose me for the program. I'm aware that there is people that have better grades then me in highschool however I hope they see that what I might lack in the high A's, I excel in working hard to achieve a goal I set out to do:)</p>
